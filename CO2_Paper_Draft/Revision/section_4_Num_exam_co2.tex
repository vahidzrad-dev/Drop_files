\section{Numerical examples}
\label{sec:num-examples}

\added{In this section, we present a set of numerical examples to demonstrate the capability of the proposed model. First, we aim to verify our implementation of the present phase field method for CO$_2$ fracturing. To this end, we present three examples with exact or otherwise well-established solutions to verify our outputs. Next, we present three more numerical example to demonstrate the capability of the proposed model. }
	
	\added{We also refer the interested readers to Wilson and Landis \cite{wilson2016phase} and Chukwudozie \cite{chukwudozie2016application} in which the phase field approach to hydraulic fracturing is verified with classical two-dimensional analytical solutions \cite{detournay2003near,hu2010plane}.}

%\added{We note our readers that it has been proved that the phase field solution of a coupled system of partial differential equations can be used for modeling hydraulic fracturing. The classical two-dimensional hydraulic fracturing model, namely KGD model \cite{khristianovic1955}, solves a plane strain problem of fluid-driven fracture evolution under a few scaling regimes as storage dominated, leak-off dominated, viscosity dominated and toughness dominated \cite{detournay2003near}-\cite{hu2010plane}. Wilson \emph{et al.}~\cite{wilson2016phase} and Chukwudozie~\cite{chukwudozie2016application} have already verified the phase field hydraulic fracture models with those analytical solutions by Detournay and Garagash~\cite{detournay2003near} and Hu and Garagash~\cite{hu2010plane}. They verified the phase field model for toughness-dominated and viscosity-dominated regimes, and found good agreement for pressure, opening, and fracture length.}

%In the first example, we follow Miehe \emph{et al.}~\cite{miehe2010phase} to provide a single-edge-notched tension test as a coupled problem of $\bm{u}$ and $d$.

%\added{In this section, we present six numerical examples to verify and demonstrate the capability of the proposed model.}  

%\added{We present \emph{four} examples with exact or otherwise trusted solutions to study how our outputs are in accordance with the analytical solutions and other works. First, we follow the example of Miehe \cite{miehe2010phase} to provide a single-edge-notched tension test as a coupled problem of $\bm{u}$ and $d$. Second, we followed an example by Detourney and Cheng \cite{detournay1988poroelastic} to study the effect of fluid pressurization on the poroelastic response around the borehole as a coupled problem of $\bm{u}$ and $p$. The third example is also a classical problem by Sneddon and Lowengrouo \cite{SneddonLowengrub69} where a monotonically increasing pressure is applied and a coupled problem is solved. The fourth example, we investigate the jointing the fractures for pressurized fractures which is motivated by Wheeler \emph{et al.} \cite{wheeler2014augmented}. }

%\added{The fifth example is proposed in Section \ref{sec: co2_propagation_ex}. We investigate the effect of CO$_2$ injection on fracture propagation. The results of breakdown pressures are verified by analytical solutions \cite{hubbert1972mechanics,haimson1967initiation}. Also, we show the results are independent to spatial and temporal discretization. In Section \ref{sec: co2_interaction_inclined_ex}, we conduct an example to investigate the interaction of CO$_2$-driven fracture  and inclined natural fractures.}

%\subsection{\added{Interaction of pressurized fractures}}
%\added{As the first example we conduct the interaction of pressurized fractures by phase field while the fluid pressure is increased. This example illustrates one of main abilities  of the phase field approach for interaction between fractures  without using any special geometry-adapted technique. }
%
%\added{Consider a computational domain of $\Omega=4$ m $\times 4$ m with three preexisting line fractures of length $2a_0=0.4$ m, i.e., $\mathcal{C}_c=[1.8, 2.2]\times\{0\}$, $\mathcal{C}_l=\{1.\}\times[1.8, 2.2]$, and $\mathcal{C}_r=\{3.\}\times[1.8, 2.2]$. To minimize the effect of the boundary conditions on the results, the domain size is much larger than the fracture length ($L\gg 2a_0$). A discretization with 19,368 standard $P_1$ elements is applied to the problem. To capture the high gradient of pressure near the fractures, the mesh is refined in that area so that an effective mesh size of $h\approx 20$ mm is adopted. while the length scale is $\ell=2h$. }

%\added{We impose zero displacements on the external boundary of $\Omega$. Also we set $d=1$ on prescribed (initial) fractures and $d=0$ on the external boundary of $\Omega$.

\subsection{\added{Increasing pressure leading to joining fractures}}
\added{This example motivated by Wheeler \emph{et al.}~\cite{Wheeler201469} demonstrates one major capability of the phase field approach that there is no need to track any complicated fracture geometry for joining fractures.}

\added{Consider a computational domain of $\Omega=(0,4.0)\times(0,4.0)$ (unit: m by m) containing two pre-existing %horizontal and vertical 
	line fractures with a length of $2a_0=0.4$ m, more precisely, $\mathcal{C}_h=[1.8, 2.2]\times\{0\}$ and $\mathcal{C}_v=\{2.6\}\times[1.8, 2.2]$. To minimize the effect of the boundary conditions on the results, the domain size is much bigger than the fracture length ($L\gg 2a_0$). A discretization with $19,368$ standard $P_1$ elements is applied such that an effective element size of $h\approx 20$ mm is obtained in the critical zone. Also, let $\ell=2h$. Figure \ref{Fig:Notched_geometry} depicts the geometric setup. A zero displacement is imposed on the boundary. Also, we set $d=1$ for the prescribed (initial) fractures, and $d=0$ on the boundary. A monotonically increasing pressure is applied on the upper and lower faces of the fracture with the magnitude $p=m\bar{p}$ where $\bar{p}=0.01$ MPa and $m=1, 2, \cdots, 115$.}

\subsection{\added{CO$_2$-driven fracture}} \label{sec: co2_propagation_ex}
In this example, we investigate the fracture propagation in a square plate with a pressurized CO$_2$ flow, with \cite{ishida2016features, wang2018influence} as the benchmarks. The specimen has edge lengths of $L=170$ mm. The geometric setup and boundary conditions are depicted in Figure \ref{Fig:Gas_geometry}. The sample is discretized into 4,832 three-noded triangular elements so that the mesh size $h\approx 5.68$ mm is obtained. Also, we set $\ell=1.6$ mm. Table \ref{Tab:Gas_input} shows the remaining parameters to be input.

	\caption{Schematic of a fractureed square plate (unit: mm) with pressurized CO$_2$ flow.}
	\label{Fig:Gas_geometry}
\end{figure}

As in Figure \ref{Fig:Gas_geometry}, there exist two preexisting fractures representing the perforations. We set $d=1$ for both fractures and set the Dirichlet boundary condition $d=0$ on the external boundary. The fluid is continuously injected into the central borehole with diameter $2r_0=20$ mm, until after the fractures propagate. Note that in this problem, the isothermal condition is adopted so that CO$_2$ is in the supercritical phase ($T=45^{\circ}$C).
%\todo[inline]{We have to mention our computation domain would be $\Omega-$ the borehole. It  is worth to mention the boundary of borehole is denoted by $\gamma_B$\\Vahid: Now that we have added Figure \ref{Fig:compute_domain}, there is no need for further explanations here.}

For the sake of simplicity, the \emph{in situ} stress \added{$\sigma_1=\sigma_3=1$ MPa} is imposed on the boundary by means of its ``equivalent'' prescribed displacement. More precisely, the displacement of the same specimen with no fracture under the same \emph{in situ} stress is first computed, then used as the Dirichlet boundary condition for the problem at hand. On the external boundary, we set $p=p_D$ where $p_D=0$. Moreover, $\Gamma_P=\Gamma_D$ in this example.

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Fracturelength_pressureboreholes_sigma_2}
    \caption{ The pressure at the top of the borehole (green line), and the fracture length function (blue line) as functions of time. The time when there is a sudden change of slope in $\mathcal{C}_{\ell}$ assumes the time corresponding to the breakdown pressure ($t=0.72t_f$) and the corresponding breakdown pressure is $p_b =10.9$ MPa. This is in agreement with H-F and H-W analytical solutions.}
	\label{Fig:Gas_pressure_Length_Sigma_i}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{Fig:Gas_snapshots} shows the evolution of phase field diagram (left) and pressure profile (right) at different time steps. As seen, the fractures propagate along a straight line, and the pressure profile is accordingly distributed with the highest gradient around the borehole.

Next, we aim to calculate the breakdown pressure $p_b$, the pressure value when %at which the rapid drop in the injection pressure occurs and with 
the fractures start to propagate.
Figure \ref{Fig:Gas_pressure_Length_Sigma_i} illustrates the pressure evolution at the top of the borehole and the fracture length function. To estimate the breakdown pressure, first we output the fracture length with regard to \eqref{Eq:Gamma_ell}.  Then, we obtain the time when the slope suddenly changes in the fracture length function ($\mathcal{C}_{\ell}$), which is the time corresponding to the breakdown pressure (here $t\approx 0.72t_f$). Hence the breakdown pressure reads $p_b =10.9$ MPa. This value for $p_b$ is in agreement with H-F and H-W analytical solutions. Also, our results agree  with experiments results of Ishida \emph{et al.}~\cite{ishida2012acoustic} within 30\%, see Table \ref{Tab:preakdown_ISO_insitustress} and the next paragraph for more elaborations.

\end{table}

\paragraph{Classical solutions of breakdown pressure} There exist two classical expressions to calculate the breakdown pressure. In the case without poroelastic effect the rock deformation does not penetrate into the pressurized fracture, the Hubbert-Willis (H-W) solution applies \cite{hubbert1972mechanics}:
\begin{equation*}
    p_b =3 \sigma_{3}- \sigma_{1}+\sigma_T,
\end{equation*}
in which the rock is assumed to be an elastic medium. When the porous medium is set, the Haimson-Fairhurst (H-F) solution is preferred \cite{haimson1967initiation}:
\begin{equation*}
    p_b=\dfrac{3\sigma_{3}- \sigma_{1}+\sigma_T+p_0}{1+\dfrac{\nu}{1-\nu}\alpha},
\end{equation*}
where we denote by $p_b$ the breakdown fluid pressure, $\sigma_{3}$, and $\sigma_{1}$ are the minimum and maximum principal stresses, respectively, and $\sigma_T$ is the rock's tensile strength.

\paragraph{Effect of $N$, $h$, and $\ell$ on the breakdown pressure}
Here we aim to study how the number of time steps $N$, the mesh size $h$, and the regularization length scale $\ell$ affect the value of breakdown pressure. As seen in Figure \ref{Fig:Gas_Pressure_parameters}, the plots show similar numerical results for the pressure evolution.

The pressure at the top of the borehole and the fracture length function, \eqref{Eq:Gamma_ell}, at different stages are  illustrated in Figure \ref{Fig:Gas_pressure_Length_Sigma_diff}. The breakdown time ($t\approx 0.77t_f$) and the corresponding breakdown pressure is $p_b =11.9$ MPa, see Table \ref{Tab:preakdown_anISO_insitustress}.

%\todo[inline]{Mostafa: Do we need keep this example? Since the results do not agree with experiments. Actually, the experiments indicate that the breakdown pressure is different for different fluids ($\mu$).\\Vahid: I added a few sentences to explain the case.}
\paragraph{Effect of dynamic viscosity on breakdown pressure} We conduct several numerical examples to investigate the effect of dynamic viscosity $\mu$ on the breakdown pressure $p_b$. 
In this set of examples an effective mesh size, the mesh size near the borehole or the fractures, $h\approx 1.6$ mm is adopted. Also, we set $\ell=2h$. In Figure \ref{Fig:Gas_Pressure_viscosity} we plot the pressure evolution up to the time when  $\mathcal{C}_\ell(t)$ changes slope, so that the end points correspond to the breakdown pressures. The results indicate that $p_b$ is approximately the same for different fluid viscosities, but the time when breakdown pressure reaches  is different. Figure \ref{Fig:Gas_Pressure_viscosity} demonstrates that the rock will break earlier for the fluid with bigger dynamic viscosity. Also it shows that regardless of the fracturing fluid, the breakdown pressure is slightly the same for all cases. This is in accordance with the physics that the breakdown pressure normally reflects the strength of the solid. However, Wang \emph{et al.}~\cite{wang2018influence} reported different breakdown pressures for different fluids which also agrees with some experiments \cite{ishida2012acoustic, ishida2016features}. We believe this discrepancy demands further research.

The \emph{in situ} stress {with the value of $\sigma_1=\sigma_3=1$ MPa} is also imposed on the boundary by means of its `equivalent' prescribed displacement. See Section 4.5 for more descriptions.}

\added{Figure \ref{Fig:Gas_Inter_snapshots} shows the evolution of the phase field profile (left) and the pressure profile (right) at different time steps. As seen, the vertical fractures propagate along a straight line until $t=0.4t_f$. Then, near the inclined natural fractures, the CO$_2$-driven fractures turns to join them with an angle of approximately $90^{\circ}$ at $t=0.8t_f$. In the last frame \ref{Fig:Gas_Inter_d_iv}, the vertical fractures deviate into the inclined natural fractures and propagate from left tips. This fracture evolving pattern is called `crossing with an offset' which is one possible interaction process of hydraulic fracture and natural fracture \cite{yew2014mechanics}.}
