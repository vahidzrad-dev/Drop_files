\ChangesListline {added}{Added}{What makes the phase field an attractive approach can be attributed to its convenience in simulating complex fracture processes, including crack initiation, propagation, branching and merging. Compared to discrete fracture descriptions, the phase field approaches avoid tracking the complicated crack geometry; instead, the crack evolution is a natural outcome of the numerical solution to a constrained optimization problem. Thus, it significantly decreases the implementation difficulty, especially when dealing with 3D problems. To illustrate this major capability, in this version, we added two more applicable examples to the manuscript; (1) increasing pressure leading to joining cracks, as Section 4.4, and (2) interaction between CO$_2$-driven fracture and inclined natural fractures, as Section 4.6. Both examples result in complicated crack topologies. At the end of Section 2, p.\nobreakspace {}9, l.\nobreakspace {}171--181, we also included a paragraph to discuss the innovation of the current model.}{5}
\ChangesListline {added}{Added}{It is also worth mentioning that Wilson \emph {et al.}\nobreakspace {}\cite {wilson2016phase} and Chukwudozie\nobreakspace {}\cite {chukwudozie2016application} have already proved that the phase field approach to hydraulic fracturing well agrees with classical two-dimensional analytical solutions \cite {detournay2003near,hu2010plane}. In this work, we extended the phase field model for hydraulic fracture to also capture compressible flow.}{7}
