\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:concl}
We have proposed {and verified} a phase field approach to simulate CO$_2$ fracturing, with CO$_2$ treated as a compressible fluid. {In one of the numerical examples, the} breakdown pressure agrees well with widely used analytical solutions. Also, the results agree with experimental results within 30\%. While this work represents the first of its kind, potentially the phase field approach allows complicated modeling of fracture initiation and branching.
